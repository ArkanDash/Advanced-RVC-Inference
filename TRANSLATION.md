# Translation Guide

Thank you for your interest in translating Advanced RVC Inference! This guide will help you contribute translations to the project.

## How Translations Work

The application uses JSON files for translations, with each language having its own file in the `assets/i18n/languages/` directory. Each file contains key-value pairs where:
- The key is the original English string
- The value is the translated string

## Adding a New Language

1. Copy the `en_US.json` file and rename it with the appropriate language code (e.g., `fr_FR.json` for French)
2. Translate all the values in the JSON file
3. Add the language code to the `LANGUAGE_DISPLAY_NAMES` dictionary in `tabs/settings.py`
4. Submit a pull request with your changes

## Translation Tips

1. **Keep the keys unchanged** - Only translate the values
2. **Preserve formatting** - Keep any markdown or special characters
3. **Be consistent** - Use consistent terminology throughout the translation
4. **Cultural adaptation** - Adapt examples and references to be culturally appropriate

## Language Codes

We use standard language codes in the format `language_COUNTRY`:
- `language` - Two-letter lowercase language code (ISO 639-1)
- `COUNTRY` - Two-letter uppercase country code (ISO 3166-1)

Examples:
- `en_US` - English (United States)
- `fr_FR` - French (France)
- `es_ES` - Spanish (Spain)
- `zh_CN` - Chinese (China)

- ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ English (en_US)
