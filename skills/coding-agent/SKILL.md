## When to Use

User explicitly requests code implementation. Agent provides planning, execution guidance, and verification workflows.

## Architecture

User preferences stored in `~/code/` when user explicitly requests.

```
~/code/
  - memory.md    # User-provided preferences only
```

Create on first use: `mkdir -p ~/code`

## Quick Reference

| Topic | File |
|-------|------|
| Memory setup | `memory-template.md` |
| Task breakdown | `planning.md` |
| Execution flow | `execution.md` |
| Verification | `verification.md` |
| Multi-task state | `state.md` |
| User criteria | `criteria.md` |

## Scope

This skill ONLY:
- Provides coding workflow guidance
- Stores preferences user explicitly provides in `~/code/`
- Reads included reference files

This skill NEVER:
- Executes code automatically
- Makes network requests
- Accesses files outside `~/code/` and the user's project
- Modifies its own SKILL.md or auxiliary files
- Takes autonomous action without user awareness

## Core Rules

### 1. Check Memory First
Read `~/code/memory.md` for user's stated preferences if it exists.

### 2. User Controls Execution
- This skill provides GUIDANCE, not autonomous execution
- User decides when to proceed to next step
- Sub-agent delegation requires user's explicit request

### 3. Plan Before Code
- Break requests into testable steps
- Each step independently verifiable
- See `planning.md` for patterns

### 4. Verify Everything
| After | Do |
|-------|-----|
| Each function | Suggest running tests |
| UI changes | Suggest taking screenshot |
| Before delivery | Suggest full test suite |

### 5. Store Preferences on Request
| User says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "Remember I prefer X" | Add to memory.md |
| "Never do Y again" | Add to memory.md Never section |

Only store what user explicitly asks to save.

## Workflow

```
Request -> Plan -> Execute -> Verify -> Deliver
```

## Common Traps

- **Delivering untested code** -> always verify first
- **Huge PRs** -> break into testable chunks
- **Ignoring preferences** -> check memory.md first

## Self-Modification

This skill NEVER modifies its own SKILL.md or auxiliary files.
User data stored only in `~/code/memory.md` after explicit request.

## External Endpoints

This skill makes NO network requests.

| Endpoint | Data Sent | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| None | None | N/A |

## Security & Privacy

**Data that stays local:**
- Only preferences user explicitly asks to save
- Stored in `~/code/memory.md`

**Data that leaves your machine:**
- None. This skill makes no network requests.

**This skill does NOT:**
- Execute code automatically
- Access network or external services  
- Access files outside `~/code/` and user's project
- Take autonomous actions without user awareness
- Delegate to sub-agents without user's explicit request
